    "## Data Preprocessing - Redone - v5\n",
    "- Stop removing punctions – This is the work of the tokenizer which already takes care of this step.\n",
    "- Welcome to Mobile WACh – Some messages still display this salutation – to be removed.\n",
    "- I suggest you exclude all control participants. These will have variable Study Group == “control” in the participant database. If you include these messages they will be 99% the welcome message.\n",
    "- We have a set of automated event-based “bounce” messages that the system sends when the above conditions are met \n",
    "    - weekend messages get a message that nurses are currently unavailable, \n",
    "    - control messages get a message that they won’t get a reply, \n",
    "    - people who have stopped messages get a message that they’re no longer active etc. \n",
    "  I’ve saved a copy of these messages in OneDrive, here. I think it may make sense to exclude these messages from your analysis, since they don’t really have any content and are triggered by the context in which the preceding participant message was sent. Let me know what you both think about this.\n",
    "- In this study, the messaging schedule is a little different. Participants receive weekly system messages until 38 weeks estimated gestation. Then 38-40 weeks they receive daily system messages. The first 2 weeks after delivery they receive 2 messages per day. Then every 2 days until 6 weeks. (See the attached paper). In the pilot dataset you used to develop the models in your paper, the schedule was: weekly until 39 weeks, extra message 3 days before delivery, once daily for 2 weeks, every 2 days until 12 weeks. Although the system messages are more frequent right before and after delivery than in the previous dataset, I don’t think this should require any change to our approach of prepending the most recent system message. It’s possible that, particularly when women are sent 2 messages per day, they may be replying to messages earlier than the immediately preceding message. But I don’t think at this point we should change our context approach. I just wanted you to be aware of how the message numbers and timing differ from the previous study.\n",
    "- Regarding the problem with some mothers’ names being regular words that have meaning (eg “baby”). Did you all come up with any strategies to deal with this? Maybe we should only remove these words from the opening sentence of system messages (where the word is inserted automatically) and leave the rest intact? I imagine participants don’t often use their own name in messages, and we’re not using the nurse messages in our fine-tuning. I think removing real words could be a problem. Tal do you have thoughts?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context generation\n",
    "    - We have seen that after ordering by participant_id and created, system messages are not always first. \n",
    "    - Rewrite the context generation function to group by participant messages first then apply system message. If participant message is not preceded by a system message, then that message will be stand alone.\n",
    "    - Add participant ID on system dataframe for additional check when merging to avoid prepending a system message to a wrong participant\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other Activities\n",
    "    - Show number of messages where modified is different from created\n",
    "- “WEEKEND:”, “NIGHT:” and “WARNING: CONTROL:” are prepended to incoming messages that meet certain conditions to help nurses. WEEKEND is messages sent over the weekend, outside of nurses’ working hours. NIGHT is messages sent at night. WARNING: CONTROL is messages from control participants. \n"
